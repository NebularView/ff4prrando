# FF4PR Randomizer
Final Fantasy 4 randomizer for Pixel Remaster

I have really no idea what I am doing however, this should randomize the following values.
* constants for higher maximum statistic caps and item stacks
* needed exp for leveling
* character growths
* ability strengths and mana costs
* armor strengths, stats, and costs
	* armor elements, procs, and group effectiveness
* weapon strengths, stats, and costs
	* weapon elements, attributes and group effectiveness
* commands and spell capabilities
* monster drops and steals
* monster command descriptions
* chest contents
* shop contents
